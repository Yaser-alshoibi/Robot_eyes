# Robot Eyes


I made this circuit using Proteus simulator. I used two RGB LED as robot eyes and Ultrasonic sensor.



# How It Will Work

When the sensor senses the costumer coming within the range 100 cm to 250 cm both eyes will glow in green.
If the customer come close (distance between the robot and customer less than 100 cm) both eyes will glow in yellow.
I did this to show more emotions from the robot and to be more interactive with the environment.
If the customer is further than 250 cm both eyes will turn off.


# Circuit construction

I used a potentiometer connected to Ultrasonic sensor to change distance to show how the circuit will respond.

I attached project file also.
I hope you like this idea!
